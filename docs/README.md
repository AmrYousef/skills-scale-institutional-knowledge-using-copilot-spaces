OctoAcme runs projects with a lightweight, repeatable lifecycle that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Projects begin with a focused one‑pager that captures the problem, measurable success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline; the decision gate to move into planning requires clear success metrics, stakeholder alignment, and team availability. Planning breaks approved initiatives into shippable backlog items (with acceptance criteria and estimates), captures dependencies and risks in a Risk Register, and produces a release plan and Definition of Done. Key artifacts include the Project One‑pager, roadmap/release plan, sprint backlog, acceptance criteria, risk register, and retrospective notes.

Work is organized around an explicit delivery workflow and small, reviewable changes. Teams use a project board with columns such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done; sprint planning pulls items that meet the DoD and have clear acceptance criteria. The PR workflow emphasizes small pull requests (<= 400 lines when possible), linking issues and acceptance criteria in PRs, running CI (tests, linting, security scans) before requesting review, and requiring at least one approval prior to merge. Releases are categorized (patch, minor, major) and follow a deployment checklist that includes staging smoke tests, rollback plans, and post‑deploy verifications.

Roles and communication are clearly defined so responsibility and information flow are consistent. Core personas are Project Manager (coordinates delivery, risks, schedules), Product Manager (defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog), Developers (implementation, tests, code reviews), QA/Testing (validate acceptance criteria), and Stakeholders (inputs/approvals). Regular cadence includes daily standups for the delivery team, weekly delivery syncs and PM–PdM alignment, sprint demos/reviews, and monthly stakeholder updates; escalation paths move from team triage to PM to Product Lead to Sponsor (with a special path for security incidents).

Quality assurance and risk management are ingrained in the process. QA expectations call for unit tests, integration tests where applicable, and end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows; manual QA is used when needed and CI enforces automated checks and security scanning. The Risk Register tracks ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation and status and is reviewed regularly; incident and rollback playbooks are defined for deployments that fail. Teams monitor velocity, burndown and product metrics via dashboards to drive data‑informed decisions and capture continuous improvement items in retrospectives with explicit action owners and follow‑ups.
